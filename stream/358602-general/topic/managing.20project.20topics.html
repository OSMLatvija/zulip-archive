<p>Hi everyone, we added some new tasks to this challenge. Just letting you know in case anyone's interested.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="568771">@Rihards Olups</span> maybe you can reopen this topic? (I don't think I have the permissions to do so)</p>

<p>But it's the same task, so splitting it into a new topic seems counterproductive.</p>

<p>That is a valid point.<br>
One problem is that "neverending" projects have a bit harder time attracting contributors (a visible end goal is a motivator). With a neverending project the goalposts are constantly moving.<br>
Another is that they reduce the potential for PR - a finished project can be advertised in some social media etc.<br>
A "neverending" project would also make for an unreadably long topic a few years later.</p>
<p>The solution would be to delimit each project phase in a separate tracking vehicle - a topic in this case.<br>
So it would be "highways pt 2", or "highways 2023-08" or similar.</p>
<p>I realise that this might seem like nitpicking to some, but large collaborative volunteer projects strive from motivation and advertising, thus this can have a much bigger impact in the long run than it might seem initially.<br>
Not super-strongly set on this topic (hehe), but I see benefits with delineating project phases, and no drawbacks.</p>

<p>I don't think 5 messages counts as a long unreadable topic. If anything, having to read through multiple topics for the same exact task is more unreadable to me. They will not appear together in the list and older ones will get lost. And you cannot easily edit messages or do anything to link them together even if you volunteer to organize it that way. What you are describing is more like tracking milestones rather than discussing a particular topic. I feel like this really needs to be in a separate location, so you have actual progress tracking. It's not like I can tell looking at any of these topics what the progress is for any of them (except a couple where you manually say that, but that gets buried in the middle of messages anyway).</p>

<p>I'm afraid it will make it very hard to keep track of project status (along with the previously listed drawbacks), but if majority prefers topic reopening, sure, we can try that approach - and please feel free to reopen the original topic :)</p>

<p>Right now I don't know how many leads we have for the whole of Latvia. What I do know however is that we've validated all of our data for Riga specifically, and that on top of the tasks we've already created, we still have about 350 leads that we'd be able to share as well.

<p>You are looking <a href="https://zulip.com/help/resolve-a-topic#mark-a-topic-as-unresolved">in the right place</a>, but you don't have required permissions. Currently only admins and moderators are able to resolve topics in our organization. I was actually unaware, that regular members can't resolve topics, and I genuinely think that that should be able, but the problem is that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolving a topic works by moving the messages to a new topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and, consequently, <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/21811">permissions to resolve topic cannot be granted independently of topic editing permissions</a>. At the moment I am not sure that giving every member an option to edit any topic would be a good idea. I would like to discuss it with other admins first.</p>
