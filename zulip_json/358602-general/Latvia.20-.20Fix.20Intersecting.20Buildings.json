When buildings intersect like this, it can make maps look cluttered and harder to read, which can be confusing. By fixing these overlaps, we’ll help make the map clearer and more accurate.</p>\n<p><strong>How Tasks Were Created</strong>  <br>\nWe generated these tasks by comparing building shapes in OSM to spot overlaps. While most tasks should highlight true intersections, some may be false positives. If that’s the case, feel free to mark them as \"Not an Issue\" and move on. </p>\n<p>Thank you and have a wonderful day,<br>\nSalim, TomTom</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/49474\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/acfd21d8ab911be3fb82d3daddb944cffd073365/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e7374726565746d61702e75732f696d672f70616765732f6d6170726f756c657474652f7369676e2e706e67&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/49474\" title=\"MapRoulette\">MapRoulette</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Be an instant contributor to the world’s maps.</div></div></div>",

It can often be used to determine building extents and make corrections. Not always possible, but in many instances much better than guessing or using aerial only.</p>",
