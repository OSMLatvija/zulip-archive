Some don't have any OSM established tags to use.</p>\n<p>There is also a daily report at <a href=\"https://osmlatvija.github.io/Osmalyzer/Non-defining%20Tagging%20report.html\">https://osmlatvija.github.io/Osmalyzer/Non-defining%20Tagging%20report.html</a> that detects these (and more) in Latvia. I've myself fixed a lot of the obvious ones before. Many of the ones remaining are harder-to-fix cases.</p>",
