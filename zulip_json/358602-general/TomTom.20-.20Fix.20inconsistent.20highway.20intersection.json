But to answer - because, unless you want to go against OSM highway classification strictly speaking, they are tracks. Someone will just revert it later and you cannot prove that you're \"right\". They are land access roads that don't lead to any properties other then forests and meadows. Unless we establish local consensus to map one way or another, there is no discussion we can point to when changing one way or another. Last discussion with more replies ended up with a split of opinions (was it on Signal?).</p>",
