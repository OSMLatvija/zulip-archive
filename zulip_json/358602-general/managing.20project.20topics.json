What you are describing is more like tracking milestones rather than discussing a particular topic. I feel like this really needs to be in a separate location, so you have actual progress tracking. It's not like I can tell looking at any of these topics what the progress is for any of them (except a couple where you manually say that, but that gets buried in the middle of messages anyway).</p>",
